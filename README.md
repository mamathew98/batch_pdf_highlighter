A complete PDF Batch Text-Highlighter GUI is now in the canvas (pdf_batch_highlighter_gui.py).
Key points:

- Drag-and-drop-free GUI â€“ choose a source folder, optional output folder, and load/edit a keyword list.

- Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to search text and add highlight annotations (yellow by default).

- Logs progress in real time and shows a summary when done.
